## About
In this project, we attempt to build a classification model using machine learning techniques
to predict an individual's risk of experiencing a heart attack based on demographic, lifestyle,
and medical characteristics. Using data from the **Heart Attack Risk & Prediction Dataset in India**,
we analyze 26 key variables to identify influential risk factors and build predictive models for early
detection and prevention. Among the 26 variables examined, factors such as Age, Alcohol Consumption, LDL
Cholesterol Level, and Emergency Response Time demonstrated notable correlations with heart attack risk.
Our analysis evaluated two predictive models: logistic regression and Random Forest, with the latter
achieving a significantly higher AUC of 0.907, compared to 0.518 for logistic regression. While our
model provides valuable insights for early heart attack risk prediction, incorporating additional
physiological markers, such as inflammatory indicators, could further enhance its predictive power.

The dataset we used covers the diverse conditions of various states in India, it comes from [Heart Attack Risk & Prediction Dataset In India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday2/heart-attack-risk-and-prediction-dataset-in-india).
